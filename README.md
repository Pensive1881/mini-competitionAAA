1) Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/Pensive1881/mini-competitionAAA.git`
2) Inside the folder of the clone repo, create a conda environment: `conda env create -f requirements.yml -n minicomp_Anvar_Alex_Albert`
3) Activate the virtual environment: `conda activate minicomp_Anvar_Alex_Albert`
4) Run Jupyter: `jupyter notebook`

Obs.: environment.yml is conda's equivalent of requirements.txt

## Data
